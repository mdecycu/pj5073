\twelve Independent study discusses Application of Web-based Content Management Systems in Teaching and Research of Precision Mechanical Engineering. Knowledge of precision mechanics is widely discussed including materials, fabrication, design and even microprocessors. These are closely related to precision and increase a lot of relevant data and technology. Therefore, all relevant information is integrated into Web-based Content Management Systems. Take the first Precision Mechanical Engineering of the restarted junior college as an application. Use Fossil software as application development to explore how to improve teaching and research applications.
